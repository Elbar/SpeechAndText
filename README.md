> <b>Author: Nicola De Nicolais</b>

## üìç Description
Android application built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose that shows how to use the functions:<br>
- **Speech-to-Text (STT)** that allow to receive the input voice through the reception from the microphone and to convert the audio into text and display it inside the box with the possibility to save the text inside a file with the extension ". txt".<br>
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** that allow to insert a text inside the box and convert the text to audio with the option to choose the tone and speed of the voice that will play the text inserted. The entry will read the text in the language configured within the code.<br>

## ‚úèÔ∏è Customization
You can custom the Speech-to-Text (STT) function by editing the settings about File's folder:

#### File's folder

If you want you can also avoid creating a folder in which to save files but let them be saved directly in the default folder


You can custom the Text-to-Speech (TTS) function by editing the settings about Language, Speech rate and Pitch:

#### Language
Change the value of *txtToSpeech.language* to set your prefered language according the available languages listed in this doc:
